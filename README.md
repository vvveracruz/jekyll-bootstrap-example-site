# A fully functional static site

This site is built with Jekyll and uses bootstrap assets. A guide on how to get here from scratch is [here](https://vgg.cz/bootstrap-jekyll-guide).

## Run locally

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/vvveracruz/jekyll-bootstrap-example-site.git`
- Navigate to the root directory `cd jekyll-boostrap-example-site`
- Make sure you have Ruby v2.5+, RubyGems, GCC and Make to run this command. To check whether you have these you can run `ruby -v`, `gem -v`, `gcc -v`, `make -v` respectively
- Install the dependencies `bundle install`
- Serve the site with jekyll `bundle exec jekyll serve`

:tada: The site will be available at `localhost:4000`.
